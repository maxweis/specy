#specy
I have not included dependency resolution in the install file. I may make a PKGBUILD to do so.

The dependencies are as follows (excluding standard Unix programs):
        python (3)
        wmctrl

Install is done through the "install" file included.
This will automatically create a directory ~/.local/share/specy

PRACTICAL NOTE:  You should run this program when your shell starts.
This can be done by adding "specy" to your .bashrc or .zshrc.
